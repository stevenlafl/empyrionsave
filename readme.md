# Building

Grab the latest release from https://github.com/stachenov/quazip and stick it into a new directory at the project root called "thirdparty".

Example: `thirdparty/quazip-0.9.1`

Now edit the empyrionsave.pro file and change the line `include(thirdparty/quazip-0.9.1/quazip.pri)` with whatever the new location like above.

Build it with Qt Creator
